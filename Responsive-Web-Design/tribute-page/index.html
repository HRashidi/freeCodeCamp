			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>John Moses Browning</strong> (January 23, 1855 – November 26, 1926) was an American firearms designer who developed many varieties 
				of military and civilian firearms, cartridges, and gun mechanisms – many of which are still in use around the world.
				He made his first firearm at age 13 in his father's gun shop and was awarded the first of his 128 firearm patents on October 7, 1879,
				at the age of 24.[3] He is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 19th and 20th centuries and pioneered
				the development of modern automatic and semi-automatic firearms.
			</p>
			<p>
				Browning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design. He invented, or made significant improvements to, single-shot, lever-action, 
				and pump-action rifles and shotguns. Arguably, his most significant contributions were in the area of autoloading firearms. He developed 
				the first reliable and compact autoloading pistols by inventing the telescoping bolt, then integrating the bolt and barrel shroud into what 
				is known as the pistol slide. Browning's telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern semi-automatic pistol, as well as 
				several modern fully automatic weapons. He also developed the first gas-operated firearm, the Colt–Browning Model 1895 machine gun – a 
				system that surpassed mechanical recoil operation to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide. 
				He also made significant contributions to automatic cannon development.
			</p>
			<p>
				Browning's most successful designs include the M1911 pistol, the water-cooled M1917, the air-cooled M1919, and heavy M2 machine gun, 
				the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR OR B.A.R.), and the Browning Auto-5 – the first semi-automatic shotgun. Some of these arms are still 
				manufactured, often with only minor changes in detail and cosmetics to those assembled by Browning or his licensees. His guns are some 
				of the most copied firearms in the world.

				John Browning passed away in his shop in 1926, working on an over/under shotgun he called the Superposed. 
				It would be the first affordable over/under shotgun of the time, and it is responsible for much of the over/under 
				shotgun’s popularity today. During his lifetime, no Browning gun ever failed a military evaluation, and no gun put 
				into production became anything less than an unqualified commercial success. He laid the foundation upon which nearly 
				all modern firearms have been built. He was a master of his craft and one of the few innovators in history who was truly 
				peerless.
