// Longest common subsequence
// The longest common subsequence (or LCS) of groups A and B is the longest group of elements 
// from A and B that are common between the two groups and in the same order in each group.
// For example, the sequences "1234" and "1224533324" have an LCS of "1234":
// 1234
// (12)245(3)332(4)
